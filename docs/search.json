During my final year in Salzburg, I was affiliated with the working group Geosocial Artificial Intelligence and moved to the Interdisciplinary Transformation University Austria with them. In Vienna, I conducted my thesis research within the working group Integrative Modelling and Management of Aquatic Ecosystems."
