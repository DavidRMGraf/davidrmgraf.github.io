# David R.M. Graf
## About me
My name is David Ruben Max Graf, I am a PhD Researcher at [GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel](https://www.geomar.de/en/) and [Kiel University](https://www.uni-kiel.de/en/).

My research focuses on understanding the movement of fish, and how it may change in a changing climate. I use inverse reinforcement learning to learn the reward functions that govern fish behavior, and use those to virtually transport fish into the climate of 2050 or 2100.

I have the privilege of being supervised by Dr. Christopher Monk in the [Marine Behavioural Ecology Group](christophermonk.fish) and [Prof. Sören Christensen](https://www.math.uni-kiel.de/stochastik/de/christensen) in the Mathematical Seminar at CAU Kiel.


## Experience & Education
I hold two Master's degrees, in Data Science from [Salzburg University](https://www.plus.ac.at/?lang=en) (2025) and in Applied Limnology from [BOKU University, Vienna](https://boku.ac.at/en/) (2022).

I have worked and published with researchers from both institutions. During my final year in Salzburg, I was affiliated with the working group [Geosocial Artificial Intelligence](https://it-u.at/en/research/research-groups/geosocial-ai/) and moved to the [Interdisciplinary Transformation University Austria](https://it-u.at/en) with them. In Vienna, I conducted my thesis research within the working group [Integrative Modelling and Management of Aquatic Ecosystems](https://boku.ac.at/en/oekb/hyam/arbeitsgruppen/imma).
